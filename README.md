# Neural_Style_transfer_using_VGG19
Neural Style Transfer Using VGG19 and applying transfer learning  

## Steps to run the Code
### Using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Recommended)
1. Clone the repository using following Steps:
 ```
        Open Colab
            └── File
                 └── Open Notebook
                          └── Github
                                └── paste the Url of the repository
 ```
 Note : Change the runtime to GPU before running the application
 ```
            Runtime
               └── Change runtime type
                           └── Select GPU
```
2. Run each cell individually

### Locally 
1. Clone the repo and Run each cell individually

Note : You must have all libraries installed 

2. If there is any library error, just install the library using the below command
``` 
pip install <library-name> 
```
Example
``` 
pip install tensorflow 
```
Note: You can install the libraries from command line or by using Jupyter notebook. Just add `!` befor the command for example:
``` 
!pip install tensorflow  
```
